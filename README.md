# Wretched and Alone JS

The humble beginings of a Wretched and Alone game engine written in Node JS

## Playing the game

Make sure you have node installed

Clone this repo and install packages

```
git clone git@github.com:itlackey/waajs.git
cd waajs
npm install
```
Once that has been done you can simply run `npm start` to play the example.

You can also run `npm start </path/to/game-config.json>` to run a different game
